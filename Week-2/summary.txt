In Week 2 of the internship, I studied Python data structures including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, and learned how to store and manipulate data using them. I implemented user-defined functions and explored lambda functions for concise data transformations. I also learned recursion by implementing a factorial function and practiced list comprehension for efficient data processing.

As part of the hands-on exercises, I performed data transformations such as calculating the sum of squares of a list and filtering elements based on conditions. For the client project, I developed a simple data cleaning script that removes duplicate values from raw data and filters the cleaned data based on a given criterion. This week helped me understand how to structure and process data efficiently in Python.
