# Skybrisk Internship – Month 1 (Data Science)

This repository contains my Month 1 internship work, completed as part of the Skybrisk Data Science Internship. The tasks focus on building a strong foundation in Python programming, data manipulation, and data visualization.

## Content

### Week 1: Python Basics
- Python variables, data types, operators  
- Input/output, conditionals, loops  
- Basic programs (temperature converter, calculator)  
- Client project: Average temperature calculation  

### Week 2: Data Structures & Functions
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets  
- Functions, lambda functions, recursion  
- Data transformations and filtering  
- Client project: Data cleaning (remove duplicates, filter data)  

### Week 3: NumPy & Pandas
- NumPy arrays, operations, broadcasting  
- Pandas DataFrames, Series, indexing, grouping  
- Client project: Dataset cleaning and aggregation (handling missing values, calculating averages)  

### Week 4: Data Visualization
- Matplotlib for basic plots  
- Seaborn for advanced plots (scatter plots, heatmaps, pairplots)  
- Client project: Visualization dashboard to analyze feature relationships  

## Tech Stack
- Python
